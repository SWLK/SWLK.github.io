Just in case anyone is interested to know the parts of my keyboards, here's a short list of specs and where I got them from:

Kyria
+ PCBs were originally bought from [MKUltra](https://mkultra.click), but they no longer carry Kyria PCBs.
	+ Currently sold by [SplitKB](https://splitkb.com).
+ Gazzew Bobagun Silent Linears (Unlubed) [Aliexpress MKZealots](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001985634467.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.65dde6f5yxcAeL&algo_pvid=f92a09c5-b4f6-4352-9bc3-cf0887bf9757&algo_exp_id=f92a09c5-b4f6-4352-9bc3-cf0887bf9757-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000018752751936%22%7D)
	+ It's quite unique of a feeling, key travel feels shorter, bottom out feels bouncy almost (gummy heh), but I came to enjoy it quite a lot.
	+ Some people say it's similar to Topre(?), I would disagree, though my Topre experience is from a Niz Atom 66 (Lubed), so don't take my word.
	+ Absolutely silent, which highlights any stabalizer rattle since that's the loudest sound coming from your keyboard.
+ Cherry stabalizers from [KeyHive](https://keyhive.xyz) lubed and clipped with bandaid mod.
	+ Honestly I would suggest getting higher end alternatives like durock stabs for tighter tolerance.
	+ The above suggestion is mainly due to any stabalizer rattle being very noticable with the bobagum switches.
	+ I mitigated stabalizer rattle with an extra O-ring on 2u keys.
		+ I know this might not make sense, but to me it made drastic improvements to the sound of the 2u keys.
		+ Bobagum switches already have tight tolerance, so I'm guessing the extra O-ring simply lessened the vibrations further when your finger hits the key.
+ Acrylic top and bottom plate from [Little Keyboards](https://www.littlekeyboards.com) (Technician Case).
	+ Not a huge deal, but the switches do not clip in to the plate on the large cut-outs for the optional 2u thumb cluster.
	+ I don't think it impacts the sound and feel in any way, it's just that there's no support between the top plate and the PCB.
	+ I've placed O-rings between the PCB and the top plate at each standoff hole, but I don't think the rings are thick enough to make a difference.
+ OLEDs and Arduino Pro Micros were sourced from [Little Keyboards](https://www.littlekeyboards.com).

> I was never a big fan of the Group Buy business model of the mechanical keyboard community.
> For me they are too expensive, and the wait times are too long to be an enjoyable experience.
> As to the quality of the above keycaps, I could really recommend the Hami Melon keycaps and the Sushi keycaps.
> The reason I'm mentioning this is because I originally used the XDA keycaps for my Kyria,
> I'm not sure if it was due to the keycap profile or the tolerance of the stem,
> but the keyboard sounds noticably better (and quieter) in my opinion with the Hami Melon and Sushi keycaps (which are both cherry profile).
> The XDA keycaps are still nice to have since they are uniform profile, and I could use them to fill in mod keys on tricky rows, but the 2u keys were noticably rattlier with the XDA keycaps.
> This could be due to the nature of bobagum switches being so silent that it highlights any kind of noises,
> and I wouldn't put the blame on the build quality of the XDAs.
> The above are just my experience.

Also a big shoutout to LittleKeyboards, whom promptly responded to my request for an exchange for a defective part, which happens, and made the process much less painful than what it could've been.

I've also been looking at the Reviung41 and the Sesame kits from [42 Keebs](https://42keebs.eu). This vendor has a lot of interesting kits (that are also otherwise hard to find) for affordable prices, so big shoutout to them as well.
