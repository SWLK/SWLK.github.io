title: Finishing The Linux CLI book and notes
---
I've just finished the book "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts. It's been a great read and I whole-heartedly recommend any noob like me to give it a try as it contains many examples and use-cases. All the information in the book are also packed in organized chapters for easy browsing when I need help on a certain topic.

I specifically chose to jot down the sections of bash-scripting because I thought that I would use it to implement a project at some point. I have been interested in Bash since last year, but I didn't have the chance to learn more about it until this year. I've always been attracted to the command line and the TUIs, due to their simplicity, ease-to-manage, and customizability.

Combined with my Kyria and my own keymap, working on the CLI feels light-weight, fast and compact. Everything that I need is usually just a few keypresses away. Coupled with a tiling window manager like i3, terminal multiplexer like tmux, and text editor nvim, I rarely have to reach for my mouse, and my hands could rest comfortably on the home row.
