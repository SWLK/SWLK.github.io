I'm Sean, and I'm currently a student in the field of Computer Science. I've previously worked in trades as a carpenter and I've also worked as a translator of film subtitles for an international documentary festival. I'm also a certified Level 3 welder and an All-Position SMAW CWB welder.

After I've switched my focus to the subject of Computer Science, I found it to be very fulfilling and exciting! There are lots of documentation and material to learn from online, free of costs. The customizability and accessibility of the subject is a big draw for me.

I hope to regularly update this site as a way to track my progress and avoid making repetitive mistakes, as well showcasing my WIP projects. I also hope to share things that I like or that I'm using, and perhaps my tweaks of them here and there.

Since the beginning of last year, I've also been a sucker for custom mechanical keyboards. I often enjoy browsing [r/MechanicalKeyboards][rmk] and [r/ErgoMechKeyboards][remk] during breaks. I've since built myself a Kyria (created by Thomas Baart and [SplitKB](splitkb.com)),a Navi10, and a MayPad, the latter two from [KeyHive](https://keyhive.xyz/). They are all flashed with my custom tweaked firmware from my fork of the [QMK_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). All three of them are powered by Arduino Pro Micros. My take of the Kyria firmware includes an animation that responds to the current WPM and displays layer changes, since the Kyria could be built with a 128x64 OLED screen on each side.

Enjoy your stay!
